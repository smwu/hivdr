Shiny app tool for sample size calculations for WHO lab-based HIVDR protocol

The code in the "Design process" folder allows the user to toggle the prevalence, precision, population size, significance level, and genotyping failure input parameters. It is intended for use in determining assumed parameter values at the survey design stage. Two plots are shown, one displaying the effect of the finite population correction on the required sample size, and one displaying confidence bands for difference prevalence misspecifications. 

The code in the "Sample size calculator" folder is meant for easy use by countries implementing the standard laboratory-based ADR survey. This option is for countries where viral load testing is at least 80% and there is at least 60% coverage of required survey variables.

The code in the "Activity 2 calculator" folder is the sample size calculator to be used for countries implementing Activity 2, where viral load testing is at least 80% but there is less than 60% coverage of required survey variables.

The code in the "Activity 3 calculator" folder is the sample size calculator to be used for countries implementing Activity 3, which uses a clinic-based survey approach for countries with less than 80% viral load testing and less than 60% coverage of required survey variables.
